If you are editing Tcl scripts for use with Synopsys tools, you will appreciate proper syntax highlighting for the command names as well as the command options. However, rather than providing a pre-compiled syntax file that will not match your installation of the Synopsys tools, this script can be used to generate them.

The script is freely available on GitHub; see more info here:
